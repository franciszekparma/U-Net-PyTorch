# U‑Net-PyTorch

An **end-to-end PyTorch implementation of U-Net** for binary image segmentation: **from data preparation through the encoder–decoder with skip connections to training, evaluation, and visualization.** **Applied to brain tumor segmentation** - a challenging medical imaging task with subtle boundaries and class imbalance.

## Prerequisites

• Python 3.8+  
• pip  
• (Optional) CUDA‑enabled GPU  

Install packages:

```
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib pillow tqdm
# optional
pip install opencv-python albumentations jupyterlab
```

---

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository  

```
git clone https://github.com/franciszekparma/U-Net-PyTorch.git
cd U-Net-PyTorch
```

* Launch Jupyter  

```
jupyter lab   # or: jupyter notebook
```

* Open and run `U‑Net/U‑Net.ipynb`

---

## Dataset Format

Expected layout (customize paths in the notebook if needed):

```
DATASET_ROOT/
├── segmentation_task/
│   ├── train/
│   │   ├── images/
│   │   └── masks/
│   └── test/
│       ├── images/
│       └── masks/
...
```

### **Notes:**
• Masks are interpreted as binary; if stored as {0, 255}, they are normalized to {0, 1}.  
• Images are resized/normalized in transforms; keep image size consistent across training/eval.  
• For imbalanced foreground, consider stronger augmentation or changing the loss / adding a weight to a paritucal part of the loss.  

---

## Training (Reference Setup)

* Epochs: **64** (reference)
* Metric: **Dice coefficient** (reported on train/test)
* Loss:   **BCEWithLogitsLoss + Dice**
* Checkpointing: best weights saved to `checkpoint.pth`  

### **Tips:**

• Start with a moderate image size if GPU memory is limited.  
• Use stronger data augmentation techniques (Horizontal Flip, ShiftScaleRotate, Blur, etc.)  
• Use the Albumentations library for image augmentation (strongly recommended)  
• Monitor Dice and loss together; verify thresholds used for binarization.  
• Save `state_dict` for portability.    

---

## Troubleshooting

• **CUDA out of memory** → reduce batch size or image size; ensure tensors are moved off GPU when not needed.  
• **All‑black or all‑white outputs** → check mask normalization and loss/thresholding.  
• **Tensor size mismatch on skip connections** → verify resize/crop/stride consistency. 


---
## The Most Important Tip  
• **Experiment with the code!** This is the best way to understand / learn all the code / theory related to the given topic.  

---
## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome — bug fixes, training tips, alternative losses (Focal/Tversky/...), multi‑class extensions, documentation improvements, other improvements to the implementation.
